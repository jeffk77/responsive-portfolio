            <p>I've been a "computer guy" since I was 4 years old, sitting at an Apple IIc computer. My Dad taught me early programming and design and gave me the chance to experiment early on.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Having that kind of young training and experience gave me the freedom to learn at any pace I could, and I loved to consume information. At that age, it consisted mostly of home tech support, but lessons are lessons!</p>
            <br>
            <p>As my career has progressed, so has my tech work. With each successive job, I brought a new skillset to bear. I began with early desktop publishing, and later added simple web designs. Eventually things grew to expansive databases and eCommerce platforms. As a life-long tech "nerd", I'm excited to see what my career will progress to next as a Full Stack Developer.</p>
